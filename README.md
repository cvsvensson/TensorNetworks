# TensorNetworks
Tensor network codes in julia by groups at AEI (GQFI and QGUT)

# How to

Here should follow a list of functions and what they do. And a general explanation on how to set up everything. 

# ToDo

1. Set up the function that computes correlation functions.

(O_i,j_i) -> MPO with O_i's at possitions j_i's and id elsewhere. -> compute expectation value of this MPO with existing function.

2. Set up the Quench of the ground state.  
2.1. Compute time dependence of expectation values after/while the quench.

3. Compute thermal state e^(beta H)

4. Compute reduced density matrices of pure and thermal state.

5. Try to compute as highly excited states as possible.

6. Check subsystem ETH for exctited states.

7. Generalize to more Hamiltonians.
